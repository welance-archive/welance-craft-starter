# Welance CraftCMS + Docker

The project is the base to fork to create new projects using craft cms.
The repository contains the 
- docker configuration for craft container
- docker-compose configuration to run the craft+mysql enviroment
- base schema customization of the craft installation
- apache configuration 
- base template for craft frontend
- utility scripts to start/stop the enviroment 
- utility scripts to import/export craft schema changes

```

## Docker HUB image

the craft cms image is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/welance/craft/)

### Publish an image

To publish an updated image of CraftCMS container to docker hub do the folowing:

```
# cd into the docker/craft folder of the base project
cd docker/craft
# build a new image (this is going to be the 'latest' tag)
docker build -t welance/craft .
# list the images and pick up the id of the images just built
docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
welance/craft       latest              18cd3db3e7df        About a minute ago   114 MB
<none>              <none>              be09b9e54c3d        About an hour ago    113 MB
...
# login to docker hub
docker login --username=yourhubusername
# tag your image  (other than 'latest')
docker tag 18cd3db3e7df welance/craft:2.6
# push the image
docker push welance/craft
```

### Docker (useful) commands

the following is a selection of docker commands that may be handy when working with docker, 
for full reference consult the [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)

- list installed images: `docker images`
- list untagged images (DANGLING) `docker images --filter "dangling=true`
- remove all untagged images `docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)`
- remove all images `docker rmi $(docker images -q)`
- list running containers `docker ps`
- list all containers `docker ps --all`
- stop all running containers `docker stop $(docker ps -q)`
- open a shell into the craft container `docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID/CONTAINR_NAME] /bin/sh`


## Workflow 

The following is the standard workflow to use with the projects using craft/docker for development

### Setup
##### Fork the starter project
create a fork of the latest release of the base repo : [https://github.com/welance/welance-craft-starter](https://github.com/welance/welance-craft-starter)

##### Run the setup script
first make sure that you have docker installed and running, you can download docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

run the `bin/setup.sh` script. the script will ask for

  - customer number
  - project number
  - slack channel
  - site name
  - local host/url 
  - npm target dir (where npm should run)


and will generate the following files:

```
./bin/config.sh
./bin/schema-import.sh
./bin/schema-export.sh
./bin/seed-import.sh
./bin/seed-export.sh
./bin/local-start.sh
./bin/local-stop.sh
./bin/local-teardown.sh
./docker/docker-compose.yml
./bin/staging-start.sh
./bin/staging-stop.sh
./bin/staging-teardown.sh
./docker/docker-compose-staging.yml
./bin/make_release.sh
```

after the setup is completed the docker environment can be started.

> **!!! ATTENTION !!!** 
> customer and project number are used to setup the containers environment, 
> they cannot be easily changed once the project is on-going.

##### Commit
commit the chagnes to the repository, in particular the changes reated to:


### Development

During the development here are the most used commands:

##### Start the docker dev environment
`bin/local-start.sh` script starts the docker containers and refreshes the schema.yaml
> **!!! ATTENTION !!!** 
> at each restart the `config/schema.yaml` will be reloaded,
> if you have made any changes to the schema you will have to export
> it before stopping the docker environment!


Once the containers are started the following ports are available:
- 80   for http
- 443  https with a self signed certificate

The default credentials (user/pass) for mysql are `craft`/`craft`.

The development phase of the project will involve 3 main resources:
- the `templates`folder
- the `condfig/schema.yaml`
- the `plugins` folder

##### Stop the docker dev environment
`bin/local-stop.sh` stops the docker conatiners. It doesn't delete the database or cms data.

##### Import/Export schema
To import/export the [craft schema](https://github.com/nerds-and-company/schematic) there is 

- `bin/schema-export.sh`
- `bin/schema-import.sh`

the schema is imported/exported from `config/schema.yml`

##### Import/Export database seed
To import/export the dump of the database that it is used to setup/seed the database

- `bin/seed-export.sh`
- `bin/seed-import.sh`

the seed sql file is imported/exported from `config/database-seed.sql`



### Staging

The staging enviroment is setup using the technique described [here](https://blog.florianlopes.io/host-multiple-websites-on-single-host-docker/) and the docker image
from [here](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy).

The staging environment is composed by a `nginx-proxy`container that registers automatically the new containers that are started having the environment variable `VIRTUAL_HOST`set. 

To run the proxy crate on the target server a `docker-compose.yml` file with the content posted below, 
and start it with the command `docker-compose up -d`

Content `docker-compose.yml` for the proxy:

```
version: '2'
services:
  nginx-proxy:
    image: jwilder/nginx-proxy
    container_name: nginx-proxy
    network_mode: bridge
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro
```

When the proxy is up you can run the containers using the project scripts:

- `bin/staging-start.sh`
- `bin/staging-stop.sh`
- `bin/staging-teardown.sh`


#### Database backup on Amazon S3 

`// TODO ` 

### Release
the script `make-release.sh` can be used to create a zip with all resources required for release

### Project removal
Once the project is finished to remove the resources associated with the project (containers and data) 
the `bin/local-teardown.sh`script is provided.

## Accessing the database
Since the database use in the containers is not accessible from outside docker a database web interface
is provided to dump/load/edit the database directly. The interface of the database is [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) and 
is available via http or https.

The urls are:
- [http://HOST/db](http://localhost/db) 
- [https://HOST/db](https://localhost/db). 

The parameters to log in are:
- System: MySQL
- Server: database
- Username: craft
- Password: craft
- Database: craft

## Apache configuration and .htaccess
The website apache configuration is stored in `./docker/craft/conf/apache2/conf.d/welance.conf`.
The welance.conf contains all the settings for the installation to work and should be taken as a reference
for production installation. By default .htaccess is _DISABLED_, [because](https://nystudio107.com/blog/stop-using-htaccess-files-no-really).
Changes to the apache configuration require to restart the environment (`bin/local-stop.sh`, `bin/local-start.sh`) to be enabled.

## Troubleshooting

**Docker**: the project folder must be located in one of the **Docker File Sharing** paths. 
You can add a folder (for example the mamp one) by edit the prefernces of your docker installation

**CraftCMS**: if you log in using HTTPS login with HTTP fails. This has someting to do with sessions
and CSRF protection. To solve the issue clear the browser application data and retry.

**Adminer**: if you log in using HTTPS login with HTTP fails. This has someting to do with sessions
and CSRF protection. To solve the issue clear the browser application data and retry.

## SSL

the certificate shipped with the project has been created using:

```
localhost:/# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1825 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout welance.ssl.key -out welance.ssl.crt
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
....................+++
....................................................................+++
writing new private key to 'welance.ssl.key'
